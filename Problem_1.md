PROBLEM 1

Problem: Red Wine Classification Using Machine Learning

Classify a red wine, using 12 different Features, in 6 different Classes (3-8) . The algorythm used for classification is An SVM (Support Vector Machine).

- *** Version 0 ****

Split Dataset to Training Set and Test Set (75% -25%) and then calculate F1 Score , Precission , Recall.
Calculate the Hyperparameters for the SVM

Then Keep the Best results

- *** Version 1 *****

Remove 33% of pH Data from the original Dataset

  Try to resolve the missing pH data problem by:
  Removing that feature completely
  Filling the missing Data With the mean value of pH
  Filling the missing data by using Logistic Regression
  Clustering using K-Means algorithm and then replacing the missing data with the average of the wine's cluster
